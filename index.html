    <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
    <p>I am fully aware of my interest as well as strength in design
and creative thinking, both of which are crucial for 
architectural studies. Moreover, I have come to learn about 
the influence of architectural design on society, as on a larger 
scale, I would be responsible for the creation of skyscrapers and 
other infrastructures of cities which may carry on to have  
historical and symbolic meaning to future generations,
potentially affecting lives of millions. And on a smaller
scale, be in charge of designing, not houses but homes which
individuals might spend the rest of their lives in. The career as 
an architect in my perspective is rousing and meaningful.</p>
